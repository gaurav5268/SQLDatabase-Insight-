# Natural Language Database Insights Project 

project demo - https://naturallanguage-sqldatabase-insight.streamlit.app/

A database insights and analytics project that allows users to explore and analyze structured database records using natural-language queries.

The system is designed to work with relational databases. SQLite is used only as a lightweight deployment database for portability and easy execution.

The application is later integrated with a Streamlit + LLM powered pipeline to automatically generate SQL queries, insights, tables, and visual charts from user queries.

The project includes:

✔ Natural Language → SQL Query Generation  
✔ Schema-Aware Database Understanding  
✔ Relational Dataset with Foreign-Key Mapping  
✔ Clean CSV-Based Data Import Pipeline  
✔ Automatic Database Build & Rebuild Support  
✔ Backend Dataset for Insight & Analytics System

## Problem Statement

Database exploration normally requires writing SQL queries manually, understanding table relationships, validating foreign-key constraints, and handling structured dataset imports. For learners, analysts, and non-technical users this becomes complex and time-consuming.

This project solves that by:

- Preparing a clean and structured relational dataset  
- Loading data in dependency-safe order  
- Preserving referential integrity  
- Enabling natural-language driven database insights  

The database serves as a backend for:

🟢 SQL learning and practice  
🟢 Data analytics and reporting  
🟢 Natural-language query understanding

## Dataset

The dataset is stored in CSV format and imported into the database.

Tables included:

employee — Employee personal and demographic details  
department — Department master data  
dept_emp — Employee–Department mapping  
title — Employee role and designation  
salary — Salary records  

The import process maintains relational consistency and foreign-key safety.

## Database Processing Pipeline

Step 1 — Create tables from schema  
Step 2 — Load data from CSV files  
Step 3 — Normalize and clean column headers  
Step 4 — Insert data in dependency-safe order  
Step 5 — Validate relational constraints  
Step 6 — Finalize database for analytics use  

This ensures:

✔ No partial or corrupt imports  
✔ No broken relationships  
✔ Consistent and reproducible dataset

## Business & Learning Objectives

This project is designed for:

✔ Understanding relational database concepts  
✔ Practicing SQL and analytical queries  
✔ Hands-on data engineering workflow  
✔ Backend dataset for insight applications  
✔ Natural-language database exploration  

Example natural-language queries supported:

- Show employees working in Finance department  
- List salaries of Senior Engineers  
- Department-wise employee distribution  
- Generate chart of employees by title  

The system converts user queries to SQL and fetches insights automatically.

## Installation & Setup

1) Install dependencies

pip install pandas

2) Run the database build script

python build_database.py

A clean database is generated:

database.db

Existing database is automatically deleted and rebuilt to ensure consistency and reproducibility.
